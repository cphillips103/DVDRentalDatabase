### Movie Rental Relational Database
*Overview:*

This project is to explore a database related to movie rentals.

### Description
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, we will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### Database used
The rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007.

Software used:
[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system that is used frequently in industry.

Object-relational databases use a hybrid approach to databases.

1. In object databases, information is stored as objects, much like object-oriented programming.

2. In relational databases, information is stored in tables with relationships between tables defined by primary and foreign keys.

Importantly, PostgreSQL allows the use of advanced functions (such as Window Functions), and even development and use of custom functions written in different programming languages. Here is a link to better understand what is meant by an object-relational database, and how it differs from a relational database.
